### Hello there 👋

I'm a software developer with interest in all things backend. I like to experiment with different frameworks and languages, currently focusing on,
- 🦫 go 
- 💻 node.js 
- 🐍 python 

Additionally, I'm also well versed with DevOps tech - CI/CD pipelines, Jenkins, Kubernetes (k8s) and beyond. 🚀  
If you want something developed and deployed to production, I'm the right person to reach.
